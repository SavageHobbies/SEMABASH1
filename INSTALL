I have put a "Makefile", type "make" to see the options there.
Essentially, the Makefile does what the following suggests.

NEW NEW NEW

To install the new .bashrc.* files, you should first take a backup
of your original .bashrc file, if there is any.
Then, copy the .bashrc* files from this directory to your home directory.

A. To make a backup of your existing .bashrc file

% cd
% cp .bashrc .bashrc.ORIGINAL

B. To install the new .bashrc* files

% cd bashrc-0.x/
% cp .bashrc* ~/

Exit the shell and logon again (or open a new window).
